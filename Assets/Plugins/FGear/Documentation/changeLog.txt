------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.11
-convex casting option
-wheel reaction forces
-ability to turn engine on/off
-tire models are converted to scriptable objects
-ability to auto calculate wheel sizes
-bug fixes & improvements

Notes
-convex casting creates a rigidbody that is marked as a trigger in order to avoid collisions.
-when you do not provide a mesh for convex casting, unity's default cylinder mesh is used.
-if you want to provide a custom mesh for casting, make sure it's size and orientation matches the unity's default cylinder model.
-you can see the convex mesh used for casting when you enable gizmo view and select the vehicle.
-some mesh colliders may have problems with convex casting, try selecting "Everything" in Cooking Options
-engine start/stop can be complemented with sound effects
-if you want to create a new tire model, use Create->FGear menu in the project panel.
-auto wheel size calculation can generate weird values in some cases.
-vehicles failed to stay on rotating objects, its fixed now.
-in some cases throttling failed to generate wheel torque when the vehicle goes backwards while in 1st gear, this is fixed now.
-SuspensionConstraint is modified to use a different limit position which behaves better when limits are wildly violated.
-SuspensionConstraint sets your vehicle's rigidbody's "solverVelocityIterations" value to be 2 as minumum.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.10
-fixed sequential gearbox bug
-auto clutch option added
-force symmetry option for tire models

Notes
-the clutch input was wrong for the sequential gearbox and it was not possible to change gears, it is fixed now
-with the manual clutch you can simulate sequential gear changes by pressing the clutch like a motorcycle or you can change like f1 gearbox with autoclutch
-tire model parameters can generate asymmetric curves and it can rarely cause problems. force symmetry option
 forces the tire model to generate a symmetric curve by mirroring the y-axis of the curve

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.9
-new suspension constraint script
-improved sticky tires

 in any case it is recommended to use SuspensionConstraint script instead
-sticky tire state is represented as a float instead of bool now. this value is used to scale tire forces to get a more consistent behavior
-previous network sample was server authoritative but was not working properly
 it seems that client predicted proper networking is not possible with physx
 we replaced the implementation with a simpler client authoritative network
-clutch state calculation bug fixed in StandardInput
-clutch power scale can result jittery behavior if you use larger values
-feedback torque calculation is clamped to avoid weak responses caused by tire model problems
-"Allow Wheel Rotation Against Engine" option had a bug that caused vehicles to move forward without throttling, it is fixed now

-sphere casting had a bug that could skip potential contacts, it is fixed now
-Tire96 could cause self steering issues, RV6 parameter is set to zero to solve the problem
-zero surface count could generate errors in Effects script, it is fixed now
-changing active car with CarManager had a problem so that the disabled car could continue with the same inputs,
 the inputs of the inactive vehicles are reset now

-over/understeer assist was active even if wheels were airborne, it is fixed now
-you set instant travel speed with setCruiseSpeed method in ArcadeAssists
-setting different radius for left/right wheels is not recommended,
 if you will do that make sure the difference is small
-drift setup is updated in drift.scene
-to throttle/brake at the same time you need to uncheck combined axis mode
-if you uncheck tire penetration, tires will stay on ground but they can penetrate the fenders
-using sphere casting may not be desirable but will be more performant than too many raycasts
-tire force scale calculation was wrong, it is fixed now 
-sticky tire option(experimental feature) removes lateral forces generated by suspensions,
 to make it work also vehicle update substepping is disabled when this mode is active

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
